The Problem Statement:
You need to design a simple application, which has 2 levels of access:

    Admin:
        Admin should have access to add, edit, remove and define user rights for all users
        Admin can write or update the database
    Recruiter:
        Recruiter should be able to provide filters based on any of the available fields (for example: Location, work experience, skills) through a simple form
        Based on the filters provided pull out the profiles from the database which match the criteria provided by the filters.
        Once the results are generated, the recruiter should be able to download the results in form of a csv.
        Recruiter can only read the database through the filters
